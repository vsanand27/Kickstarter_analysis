Performing analysis on Kickstarter dataset to uncover trends



# Outcomes Based on Goals

#Objective: To review “Plays” as subcategory by Goal to review Outcome.

# Summary
Based on our analysis, the takeaways show high level outcome trends.  The outcome based on “Goals” approach is very simplistic and the outcome may differ if reviewed by Geographic area, Customer Segmentation, and the re-defining “Success”.   

There, we propose the re-defining “Success” and performing analysis using the following:
a)	Step 1: further analyzing the dataset for Plays by region and length of the play
b)	Step 2: Include actual cost incurred to develop and execute plays.  Therefore, the profit from running the play should be considered actual net goal and net pledge.  
c)	Actual within 95% confidence interval to be classified as successful

# Key-Takeaways from Analysis 
1.	Overall “Plays” are 66% successful and 34% Fails. However, Data suggest that no plays were cancelled; I believe this is a limitation in dataset and may require further research.  Please note "Live" status is not included in the status as the outcome is still in progress. 
2.	The probability of play being successful more than 50% of times is when the “Goal” is assigned $19,000 or below as value.  After $19,000 the probability of success starts to diminish.
3.	Exception: Plays Between $35K and $45K goals have higher success rate, this suggest these are unique and popular “Classic” plays that people have higher chance of attending.  That’s why the number of plays were only 9.

# Limitations 
1.	Goal and the outcomes may differ between countries based on customer profiles
2.	$ Goal assigned may not be true reflection of play performance.  First, Goals could be assigned lower and conservative to increase the chances of classifying them as successful.  Second, in real world, any actual with-in 95% confidence interval can potentially be deemed as successful.
